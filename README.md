# Doodle Hop

A browser clone of the classic Doodle Jump. Leap from platform to platform, climb as high as you can, and chase a new high score.

## Controls

- `A` / `←` — move left
- `D` / `→` — move right
- `Space` — restart after a fall

Wrapping is enabled: leaving one side of the screen brings you back on the opposite side.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL that Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173) and start jumping.

## Build

```
npm run build
```

The optimized bundle is emitted to `dist/` and can be deployed to any static host.
